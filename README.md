# rnn-pipeline-for-errp-decoding (2024)
This repository contains the implementation of an end-to-end signal processing and RNN-based deep learning pipeline for single-trial decoding of the presence and absence of error-related potentials from recorded scalp EEG. This is a generic decoder, meaning it is trained across data from multiple participants and tested on an entirely unseen participant (“plug-and-play” decoding).
